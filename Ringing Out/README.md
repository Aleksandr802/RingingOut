- Send `"S"` to stop beeping

## üì≤ How to Use

1. Make sure your ESP32 device is advertising with the correct service/characteristics.
2. Launch the app on your iOS device.
3. The app will scan and automatically connect to the `ESP32_WROOM_BLE_Ringout`.
4. Receive alerts and play beeps when triggered from ESP32.
5. Tap **Test Ringing Out** to manually test sound/vibration/notification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Permissions Required

- **Bluetooth** access
- **Notifications** (Critical alerts, badges, sound, banners)
